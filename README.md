# Bedaquiline-Model
Whole-body PBPK model of bedaquiline.

## Repository files
Within this repository, we share a whole-body PBPK model of bedaquiline and its metabolite N-desmethyl bedaquiline (M2). The model was developed using data of 3 clinical studies (dosing range 100â€“700 mg). 

The PK-Sim project file contains simulations and the observed data of all clinical studies used for model development and evaluation. For further details, quantitative model evaluation, sensitivity analysis and extensive documentation please refer to [[1](#main-reference)].
