The PBPK model for bedaquiline and its metabolite N-desmethyl bedaquiline (M2) was developed and verified with clinical pharmacokinetic data.

The model was evaluated covering data from studies including in particular

* oral administration
* multiple dosing (range 100-700 mg)
* bedaquiline and its M2 metabolite

The model quantifies metabolism of bedaquiline via CYP3A4, CYP2C8 and additional hepatic metabolism and total hepatic clearance of M2.

The next sections show:

2. the overall goodness of fit: [Section 3.2](#diagnostics-plots).
3. simulated vs. observed concentration-time profiles for the clinical studies used for model building and for model verification: [Section 3.3](#ct-profiles).
