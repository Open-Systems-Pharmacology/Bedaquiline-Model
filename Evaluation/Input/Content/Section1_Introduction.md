The presented model building and evaluation report evaluates the performance of a PBPK model for bedaquiline and its metabolite N-desmethyl bedaquiline (M2) in adults. 

The herein presented model was developed and published by Mehta et al. [Mehta 2024](#main-references). Mehta et al. (2024) also report the extension of the model in MoBi to incorporate cranial and spinal cerebrospinal fluid. The PBPK model reported here is limited to PK-Sim and updated to V12.

Bedaquiline is a bactericidal antimycobacterial medicine primarily used in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis [Khoshnood 2021](#main-references). Bedaquiline inhibits mycobacterial ATP synthase, an enzyme essential for the production of ATP. As a result bedaquiline disrupts the bacterial energy metabolism and survival.

Bedaquiline shows low solubility but high permeability, and is therefore classified as Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) Class II. Bedaquiline reached maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) after about 5 hours, and shows increased oral bioavailability when administered with food [van Heeswijk 2014](#main-references). Bedaquiline is extensively distributed to tissues and highly protein-bound (>99.9 %). Bedaquiline is metabolized via cytochrome P450 enzymes (primarily CYP3A4) into N-desmethyl bedaquiline (M2). M2 does not significantly contribute to clinical efficacy due to its lower exposure and activity, but has been correlated with QT prolongation. Fecal excretion is the major elimination route.

The herein presented model building and evaluation report evaluates the performance of the PBPK model for bedaquiline and M2 in adults. The model was developed using data of 3 clinical studies (dosing range 100â€“700 mg) for oral administration. 

The presented bedaquiline PBPK model as well as the respective evaluation plan and evaluation report are provided open-source ([https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Bedaquiline-Model](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Bedaquiline-Model)).
